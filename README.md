# The Game of Set

Instructions:

To run the game, open GameEngine.rb in Ruby via the terminal!
Ensure the terminal window is wide enough to render the cards in the CLI properly.
In the future, this game would benefit greatly from having a GUI implemented, and more features.


Comments:

The requirements for multiple players seemed.. nonsensical? I'm not sure how that was intended to be implemented in a meaningful way as a solo project without a GUI.
I did my best to provide the bare working features of the game of Set, and with more time or group cooperation would be happy to hash this out and develop it further.
